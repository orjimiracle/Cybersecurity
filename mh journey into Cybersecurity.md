Hi everyone,

My name is Orji Ekeoma Miracle, and I am currently studying Cybersecurity at AltSchool Africa . I chose cybersecurity because it perfectly aligns with my passion for technology and my desire to protect systems, data, and people from ever-evolving cyber threats.

Years ago, I ventured into building construction, gaining valuable on-site experience and mastering tools like Revit, Artlantis, AutoCAD, and Archicad. Despite these skills, my true passion for cybersecurity has always stood out. The pull to secure and explore the digital world never faded, and I’m grateful to those who reignited my passion for tech.

As my friend Chinwendu S. ☁️♾️  fondly said during our undergraduate days at Michael Okpara University of Agriculture, Umudike, Abia State, "When you were writing some code in QBasic, I was just imagining what you were doing!" His words reminded me of my early days in tech and reignited my passion for it. I honestly can’t thank him enough.

A special thanks also goes to chinedum Abel-Onyemuwa  and Chinonso Iwundu . I'm absolutely grateful for your encouragement and unwavering support. Your advice gave me the clarity and determination I needed to pursue cybersecurity, and today, I am confident I’m on the right path.

Now, I am fully committed to growing as a cybersecurity professional, with a strong focus on becoming a skilled penetration tester.

The journey has just begun, and the cloud is our starting point! I look forward to connecting with like-minded individuals as we work together to make the digital world more secure and innovative.

Let’s build a safer future, starting now!
