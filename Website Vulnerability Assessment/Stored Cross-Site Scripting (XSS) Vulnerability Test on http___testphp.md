**Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability Test on [http://testphp.vulnweb.com/](http://testphp.vulnweb.com/) Using Comment Section**

**Introduction**

In this lab, I tested the website [http://testphp.vulnweb.com/](http://testphp.vulnweb.com/) for stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities by injecting a malicious JavaScript payload into the comment section on the guestbook page. My goal was to see if the website saves the script and runs it for all users who visit the page, which would show a stored XSS vulnerability. I found that the website is vulnerable to stored XSS because my script was saved and executed, displaying an alert box. This taught me how dangerous stored XSS can be and why we need to secure websites to protect users from attacks.

**Lab Environment**

* Machine: My personal laptop (Windows 10\)  
* Network: Connected to the internet using Wi-Fi  
* Target Website: [http://testphp.vulnweb.com/](http://testphp.vulnweb.com/) (a test site for learning about security)  
* Tools:  
  * Web Browser: Google Chrome (version 123.0.6312.86)  
* Date and Time: April 14, 2025, 05:55 PM PDT

**Execution Steps**

1. Setting Up the Environment

    I used my laptop for this test, which was connected to the internet via Wi-Fi. I opened Google Chrome to access the target website, [http://testphp.vulnweb.com/](http://testphp.vulnweb.com/). This website is designed for security testing, so it’s safe for me to experiment with. I didn’t need any special tools, just my browser to test for stored XSS.

2. Identifying the Comment Section for Testing

    I explored the website to find a place where user input is saved and displayed to others. On [http://testphp.vulnweb.com/](http://testphp.vulnweb.com/), I found the guestbook page at [http://testphp.vulnweb.com/guestbook.php](http://testphp.vulnweb.com/guestbook.php). This page has a comment form where users can submit messages, and the comments are shown below the form for everyone to see. This is a good place to test for stored XSS because the comments are stored on the server and displayed to all visitors.

3. Creating the JavaScript Payload

    I created a simple JavaScript payload to test for stored XSS. The payload was:  
    \<script\>alert('Stored XSS')\</script\>  
    This code makes a pop-up alert box appear in the browser with the message “Stored XSS”. If the website saves this payload and runs it when someone visits the page, it means the website is vulnerable to stored XSS.

4. Injecting the Payload into the Comment Section

    I went to [http://testphp.vulnweb.com/guestbook.php](http://testphp.vulnweb.com/guestbook.php) in Google Chrome. In the comment form’s text area, I entered my payload:  
    \<script\>alert('Stored XSS')\</script\>  
    Then I clicked the “Submit” button to post the comment. The page refreshed, and I saw my comment appear in the list of messages below the form.

5. Observing the Behavior

   When the page refreshed after submitting the comment, an alert box popped up with the message “Stored XSS”. This meant the browser ran my JavaScript code, showing that the script was saved on the server. I refreshed the page again, and the alert box appeared each time, confirming the script was stored. This proved that the website is vulnerable to stored XSS because the script runs for anyone who visits the guestbook page.

**Results**

* Vulnerability Confirmed: The website [http://testphp.vulnweb.com/](http://testphp.vulnweb.com/) is vulnerable to stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The comment form on the guestbook page ([http://testphp.vulnweb.com/guestbook.php](http://testphp.vulnweb.com/guestbook.php)) allowed my JavaScript payload to be saved and executed.  
* Details: After submitting the payload \<script\>alert('Stored XSS')\</script\> in the comment form, the script was stored on the server. When the guestbook page loaded, the browser ran the script, and an alert box with the message “Stored XSS” appeared. This shows the website doesn’t sanitize user inputs in the comment form, making it vulnerable to stored XSS attacks.

**Learning Outcomes**

This lab showed me how serious stored XSS vulnerabilities can be. Because the website saved my script in the comment section and ran it every time the page loaded, an attacker could use this to do harmful things, like stealing user information or showing fake login pages to trick people. I learned that stored XSS is especially dangerous because it affects all users who visit the page, not just the person who submits the script. 

**Conclusion**

In this lab, I tested [http://testphp.vulnweb.com/](http://testphp.vulnweb.com/) for stored Cross-Site Scripting vulnerabilities by injecting a JavaScript payload into the comment section on the guestbook page. I confirmed that the website is vulnerable because my script was saved and ran for anyone who visited the page, showing an alert box. As a blue team student, I now understand why we need to protect websites from stored XSS by checking inputs, encoding data, and using secure tools. This will help me in my future work to keep systems safe from attacks that could harm users
