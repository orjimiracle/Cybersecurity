**Capturing Plaintext Credentials from [http://testphp.vulnweb.com/](http://testphp.vulnweb.com/) Using Wireshark**

**Introduction**

In this lab exercise, I logged into the website [http://testphp.vulnweb.com/](http://testphp.vulnweb.com/) on my laptop, captured the network traffic using Wireshark, and identified the credentials sent over the network. As a blue team member, my goal was to understand how attackers can easily capture sensitive data if proper security measures aren’t in place, so I can better protect systems in the future. I found that the credentials were sent in plaintext because the website uses HTTP, not HTTPS, which made them very easy to see in the captured traffic. This showed me how important it is to use encryption to keep data safe.

**Lab Environment**

* Machine: My personal laptop (Windows 10\)  
* Network: Connected to the internet using Wi-Fi  
* Target Website: [http://testphp.vulnweb.com/](http://testphp.vulnweb.com/) (a test site for learning about security)  
* Tools:  
  * Wireshark (version 4.2.4) to capture network traffic  
  * Google Chrome (version 123.0.6312.86) to log into the website  
* Date and Time: April 14, 2025, 04:33 PM PDT

**Execution Steps**

1. Setting Up Wireshark

    I started by opening Wireshark on my laptop. Since I needed to capture network traffic, I ran Wireshark as an administrator by right-clicking the icon and choosing “Run as administrator.” This let me capture packets properly. In Wireshark, I saw a list of network interfaces, and I picked my Wi-Fi interface because that’s how my laptop connects to the internet. To make sure I only captured the traffic I needed, I used a filter: http.request.method \== "POST" && ip.dst \== testphp.vulnweb.com. This filter told Wireshark to only show POST requests going to the website, since POST is used for login forms. Then I clicked the green shark fin button to start capturing packets.

2. Logging Into the Website

    Next, I opened Google Chrome on my laptop and went to [http://testphp.vulnweb.com/login.php](http://testphp.vulnweb.com/login.php). This website is a test site for learning, so it’s okay to use for this kind of experiment. I noticed it uses HTTP, not HTTPS, which means the data isn’t encrypted. I entered the test credentials that work for this site:

   * Username: admin  
   * Password: password Then I clicked “Login” to send the credentials to the website.

Analyzing the Traffic in Wireshark

 After logging in, I went back to Wireshark to look at the captured traffic. I saw a packet that matched my filter. It was an HTTP POST request to /AJAX/showxml.php, which is where the login form sends the data. The packet looked like this:  
Source: \[My IP\], Destination: testphp.vulnweb.com, Protocol: HTTP, Info: POST /AJAX/showxml.php HTTP/1.1  
I right-clicked the packet and chose “Follow \> HTTP Stream” to see the full details. In the stream, I found the form data:  
uname=admin\&pass=password

3. This showed me the credentials I entered: Username is admin, and Password is password. Because the website uses HTTP, the credentials were in plaintext, which means anyone capturing the traffic could read them.

4. Stopping and Saving the Capture

    I stopped the capture in Wireshark by clicking the red square button. Then I saved the captured packets so I could use them for my report. I went to File \> Save As and named the file testphp\_login\_capture.pcapng.

**Results**

* Credentials I Found:  
  * Username: admin  
  * Password: password  
* Details: The credentials were sent in an HTTP POST request to /AJAX/showxml.php on [http://testphp.vulnweb.com/](http://testphp.vulnweb.com/). Since the website uses HTTP instead of HTTPS, the credentials were in plaintext, which made them very easy to see in the captured traffic.

**Evidence of Traffic Capture**

* Figure 1: Wireshark Capture of HTTP POST Request This shows the HTTP POST packet to /AJAX/showxml.php with the form data uname=admin\&pass=password.  
* Figure 2: HTTP Stream View This shows the full request, where I could see the credentials in plaintext.

**Learning Outcomes**

As a blue team student, this lab taught me a lot about why encryption is so important. Since HTTP sends data in plaintext, the credentials (admin:password) were easy to capture, even without doing anything fancy like an MITM attack. If someone had malware on my laptop or was on the same network, they could capture the same data. This makes me realize how dangerous it is to use HTTP for sensitive information like logins. Using HTTPS would encrypt the data, so even if someone captured the traffic, they couldn’t read the credentials. I also learned how to use Wireshark better, like how to use filters (http.request.method \== "POST") and follow HTTP streams to find important data. This will help me in my blue team work to monitor networks and spot when something isn’t secure.

**Conclusion**

In this lab, I logged into [http://testphp.vulnweb.com/](http://testphp.vulnweb.com/) with the credentials admin:password, captured the traffic using Wireshark on my laptop, and found the credentials in plaintext in an HTTP POST request. This showed me how easy it is to capture sensitive data when a website doesn’t use HTTPS.

I now understand why we need to make sure websites use encryption to protect users. I also learned how to use Wireshark to analyze traffic, which will help me in my future work to keep networks safe. Next, I’d like to try logging into a website with HTTPS to see how the traffic looks when it’s encrypted.
