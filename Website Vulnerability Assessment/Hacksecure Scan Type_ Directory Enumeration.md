## **Introduction**

This is a basic web reconnaissance report based on a directory enumeration scan of http://testphp.vulnweb.com. The objective was to discover exposed directories and files that might be useful for further security analysis or indicate misconfigurations.

**Scan Type:** Directory Enumeration

**Tool Used:** Gobuster v3.6 Wordlist Used: /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt 

## **Command Used**

gobuster dir \-u http://testphp.vulnweb.com/ \-w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt

## **Methodology**

The scan was performed using Gobuster with the common.txt wordlist from the DIRB toolset. The configuration was as follows:

* Target: http://testphp.vulnweb.com  
* Threads: 10  
* Wordlist: /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt  
* Timeout: 10 seconds  
* Ignored Status Code: 404

## **Scan Results**

The following paths were discovered during the scan:

/admin/ \- 301 (Redirect)  
/cgi-bin/ \- 403 (Forbidden)  
/crossdomain.xml \- 200 (OK)  
/CVS/ \- 301 (Redirect)  
/CVS/Entries \- 200 (OK)  
/CVS/Repository \- 200 (OK)  
/CVS/Root \- 200 (OK)  
/favicon.ico \- 200 (OK)  
/images/ \- 301 (Redirect)  
/index.php \- 200 (OK)  
/pictures/ \- 301 (Redirect)  
/secured/ \- 301 (Redirect)  
/vendor/ \- 301 (Redirect)

## **Analysis**

* /admin/: Likely an admin login panel. Could be tested for login vulnerabilities.  
* /cgi-bin/: Directory exists but is forbidden. It may contain legacy scripts that could be exploitable.  
* /crossdomain.xml: Cross-domain policy file; if misconfigured, it could allow unauthorized access from other origins.  
* /CVS/: CVS metadata is publicly accessible. This can lead to information disclosure about the applicationâ€™s source code.  
* /index.php: The main application page. Might be worth testing further for input validation issues (e.g., SQL injection, XSS).  
* Other folders like /secured/, /vendor/, /images/, and /pictures/ may contain static files.

## **Recommendations**

1. Protect sensitive directories like /admin/ and /cgi-bin/ with proper authentication and access controls.  
2. Remove source control artifacts such as CVS folders from the live server.  
3. Review the contents of crossdomain.xml to ensure only trusted domains are allowed.  
4. Disable directory listing and set strict file permissions.  
5. Perform further testing on /index.php and other exposed pages for vulnerabilities.

## **Conclusion**

This scan helped identify several interesting paths that could be further investigated. Even a simple directory scan can uncover potential security issues that shouldn't be ignored in a real-world application.
